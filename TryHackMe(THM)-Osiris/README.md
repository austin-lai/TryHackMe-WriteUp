## Task 1

```markdown
As a final blow to Windcorp's security, you intend to hack the laptop of the CEO, Charlotte Johnson. You heard she has a boatload of Bitcoin, and those seem mighty tasty to you. But they have learned from the previous hacks and have introduced strict security measures.

However, you dropped a wifi RubberDucky on her driveway. Charlotte and her personal assistant Alcino, just drove up to her house and he picks up the bait as they enter the building. Sitting in your black van, just outside her house, you wait for them to plug in the RubberDucky (curiosity kills cats, remember?) and once you see the Ducky’s Wifi network pop up, you make a connection to the RubberDucky and are ready to send her a payload…

This is where your journey begins. Can you come up with a payload and get that sweet revshell? And if you do, can you bypass the tightened security? Remember, antivirus tools aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed, sometimes changing the code a little bit and recompiling the executable can bypass these simplest of detections.

As a final hint, remember that you have pwned their domain controller. You might need to revisit Ra or Ra2 to extract a key component to manage this task, you will need the keys to the kingdom... 

Info: To simulate the payload delivery, we have put up a TFTP-server on the target computer. Use that, to upload your RubberDucky-scripts.

Important: The TFTP server itself, any software or scripts you find regarding the RubberDucky is not a part of the challenge.

Also; remember you are deploying Ducky-script to a box with limited resources. Give it more time than you usually would, to finish the tasks.

The box will need about 5 minutes before it is fully operational.

Please do NOT post write-ups or stream solution until it has been out for at least two weeks.
