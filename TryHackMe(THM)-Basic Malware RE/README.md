## Task 1

Nothing to solve, read through the introduction.

## Task 2

This task is quite easy, load the executable into IDA or Ghidra.

Have you check what's the function generate MD5? Have you check the strings?

<br />

## Task 3

Same, once you check out the executable from IDA or Ghidra, you will saw the answer is right there.

<br />

## Task 4

For this task, have you check on the specific function perhaps "LoadStringsA" ?

Have you done research with the binary and the function call, system call?
